.SH NAME
xmtoolbox - application launcher
.SH SYNOPSIS
xmtoolbox [-rcfile <file>] [-horizontal] [-hotkey [modifier[+\.\.\.]]+key]
.SH DESCRIPTION
XmToolbox displays a user defined, multi\-level menu of application groups
and applications. It also interfaces with the xmsm(1) session manager to
provide screen locking and session commands.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-rcfile\fP \fI<full path>\fP
Specify a configuration file to use. See \fBCONFIGURATION\fP for details.
.TP
\fB\-title\fP \fIString\fP
Specify toolbox window title. Default is user's login name and the host name.
.TP
\fB\-hotkey\fP \fI[Modifier ...] Key\fP
Hotkey to raise and focus the toolbox window\.
See the resource description below\.
.TP
\fB\-horizontal\fP
Specifies whether the top\-level menu should be laid out horizontally,
rather than vertically.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
XmToolbox reads its menu configuration from text files. If not specified
on command line with the \fB-rcfile\fP option, its location defaults to
\fB.toolboxrc\fP in user's home directory and \fBtoolboxrc\fP in any of system
configuration directories e\.g\. /etc/X11, /usr/lib/X11\.
.PP
A menu is defined by specifying the menu title followed by one or more menu item
definitions enclosed in {\.\.\.} brackets. Menu items are specified one per line,
starting with the title string separated by the : character from the command\(dg
to be executed. A horizontal line may be added between menu items with the
special identifier SEPARATOR. Any character in the title string may be prefixed
with the ampersand character to specify a mnemonic. Comments may be entered
following the # character at the beginning of a line. Sub\-menus may be defined
by placing them within the scope of the parent menu. Menu scope {} delimiters
may only be placed at the beginning of an otherwise empty line. 
.PP
Literal & and : characters in title strings may be specified by prefixing them
with the \\ escape character. Literal whitespace characters in the command
string may be specified either by escaping them with \\, or enclosing the part
of the string in quotation marks\.
.PP
The command string may contain sh(1) like ($\.\.\. and ${\.\.\.}) environment
variables, which will be expanded accordingly. A literal $ may be specified
with $$. Undefined variables are not treated as error, and expand to nothing,
though a warning is printed to stderr\.
