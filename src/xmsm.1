.SH NAME
xmsm/xmsession \- X session manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
xmsm [options]
.br
xinit xmsession
.br
xdm \-session xmsession
.SH DESCRIPTION
XmSm is a Motif based session manager for EMWM. In provides screen locking,
workspace configuration settings and shutdown options\. It is also responsible
for starting the window manager (emwm), the application launcher (xmtoolbox)
and other, user defined applications\.
.SH USAGE
XmSm is normally started by the accompanying xmsession initialization
script that sets up the environment, redirects stdout and stderr to
~/.xmsession\.log, loads ~/\.Xresources and sources ~/\.Xprofile before running
the session manager\.
.PP
The xmsession script itself should be invoked either by a display/login manager
like xdm, or the xinit utility.
.PP
~/.Xprofile is the startup file for X sessions and analogous to the ~/\.profile
file where user specific environment variables may be set\.
.PP
 ~/.sessionetc is a shell script that is processed in a separate shell,
and may be used to start user\-specific programs\.
