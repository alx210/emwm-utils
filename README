UTILITIES FOR EMWM
==================
xmsm is simple session manager that provides session configuration and screen
locking and also launches the window manager and the toolbox.

xmtoolbox is an application launcher/menu configured with a simple text file.
It also communicates with the session manager to provide lock, log out, and
shutdown commands.

Example toolbox configuration file (toolboxrc) is provided in the src directory,
and also installed into the X11 config directory.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================
X11 and Motif libraries and headers are required to build all utilities.

To modify installation prefix and other options, edit the target platform
specific makefile in the "mf" subdirectory (The target platform name is picked
from uname(1)).

Run 'make' in the top-level directory of the source distribution.
After the build process finishes, run 'make install' as root.

NOTES
=======================
The session manager may be run from XDM by setting the DisplayManager*session
X resource in xdm-config to xmsession, or by execing xmsm from ~/.Xprofile.
Just make sure to test whether it works by running 'xinit xmsession' before
doing any of the above. Note that 'xmsession' is just a shell script that sets
up the environment for xmsm, and is not needed when this has been done already.
-
xmsm is installed suid root, this is required for screen locking and running
sbin commands. Privileges are dropped at startup and are reacquired only when
necessary.
-
System shutdown, reboot and suspend commands can be altered at compile time
only. Edit constants in smconf.h, or override them in CFLAGS if necessary.
